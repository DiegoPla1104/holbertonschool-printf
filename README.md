# Printf Proyect

The function printf is used to output a specified type of data to the user

Depending on the options that you give, the output varies

## Usage

```C
#include <stdio.h>

# outputs an integer(number) followed by a new line
printf("%d\n", variable) (another way to output an int is with "%i")

# outputs a character followed by a new line
printf("%c\n", variable)

# outputs a string of characters followed by a new line
printf("%s\n", variable)
```

## What we did

We made a function that works in similar ways to the printf function

It's called "_printf"

## How does it work

It's usage is the same as the normal printf

_printf("text %option text", variable)
